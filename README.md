## Prerequisites

You need an OpenAI API key to run this application. Get one from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## API Endpoints

### Get All Patients

```
GET /api/patients
```

Returns a list of all patients with basic information.

### Get Patient Details

```
GET /api/patient/[patientId]
```

Returns complete patient data including:
- Personal information (ID, name, age, gender)
- Physical measurements (height, weight, BMI)
- Blood pressure readings
- Blood sugar levels
- Complete cholesterol profile (HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides)
- Lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, physical activity)

### Analyze Patient

```
GET /api/analyze/[patientId]
```

Returns comprehensive AI-powered health analysis for a specific patient including:
- Health scores
- Risk category
- Future health risks
- Recommendations
- Recommended lifestyle programs

## How It Works

### AI-Powered Analysis

The system uses OpenAI's GPT-5.1 Chat Latest model to provide intelligent health analysis:

1. **Data Collection**: Patient vitals, lifestyle factors, and medical data are collected
2. **AI Processing**: Data is sent to GPT-5.1 with a structured prompt
3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: AI analyzes across three dimensions:
   - **Cardiovascular Health**: Blood pressure, cholesterol levels, HDL/LDL ratios
   - **Metabolic Health**: Glucose levels, BMI, age-related factors
   - **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity
4. **Intelligent Scoring**: AI generates scores (0-100) for each dimension and overall health
5. **Risk Assessment**: Categorizes patients into risk levels with detailed explanations
6. **Future Risk Prediction**: Identifies potential health conditions with probability and timeframe
7. **Personalized Recommendations**: Generates specific, actionable health advice
8. **Program Mapping**: Matches patients to relevant lifestyle programs

### AI Model

- **Model**: GPT-5.1 Chat Latest (gpt-5.1-chat-latest)
- **Features**: Advanced reasoning, clinical knowledge, structured JSON output
- **Temperature**: 0.7 for balanced creativity and accuracy

## Sample Data

The application includes 6 diverse patient profiles with varying health conditions:
- John Anderson (45, high cardiovascular risk)
- Sarah Mitchell (38, healthy profile)
- Michael Chen (52, multiple risk factors)
- Emily Rodriguez (29, optimal health)
- Robert Thompson (61, moderate risk)
- Jennifer Park (34, borderline indicators)

## Environment Variables

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## API Usage

The analyze endpoint uses OpenAI API credits. Each patient analysis costs approximately:
- Input tokens: ~500-800 tokens
- Output tokens: ~400-600 tokens
- Estimated cost: $0.01-0.02 per analysis (GPT-5.1 pricing)
